						I also used random forest regression to investigate when experimental data inform a classifying statistical model which dimensions explain the most of the observed variance in the feature space. Variance-explained will facilitate the production of a list of improvements to make to our models in order to render models better imitations of real data.
						In this project you can see use of:</li>
						PCA, t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE).
						Random Forest Classification (RFC) using 38 features, and also RFC applied to just 2 features (output from PCA).
						using the RFC "variance-explained" feature. 
						Plotting of a decision boundary. (need to redo). 
						Not done yet, but pending Cross-Validation using looping over many different test/train splits.

							<em> Model Optimization as a data pre-processing stage.</em> </strong></li>
							Before Machine Learning and analysis techniques could be applied,
							 we needed to find optimized models. These optimized 
							 models can be understood as models that are intended to 
							 be superior mimics of real biologically derived data, as 
							 their governing equation parameters have been more rigorously 
							 constrained  by a wider range of experimental data.
							In order illustrate that the optimized models are better 
							imitations of real data, four adaptive Exponential models, and 
							four Izhikevich models each were fitted to four different classes 
							of experimental cells see implementation in ipython notebook 
							These eight fitted models were subsequently fed into a 
							Druckman feature extraction algorithm, and added as data points in a dimension reduced plot of the feature space. Many pre-existing neural models, and some Allen Brain Data where also plotted as contextual data in the same feature space.

					<li>If biologically realistic models were better at imitating real experimental cells,
						 then data and models would not easily be discriminable. By plotting a 48 dimensional feature space onto a two dimensional projection space, I show that a diverse pool of data and models are readily discriminated via Random Forest Classification, a result, that leaves even some of the most optimized models lacking. The idea is that the models 
						which are the most resistant to being correctly machine-classified
						 as models (therefore being misclassified as data), serve as better
						  imitations/mimics of experimental data.

                    <li> Python, pandas sklearn, dask were all used for Model
                     Optimization pre-processing steps, and for plotting the models in a dimension reduced
                      feature space.</li>
					<li> Models versus Data. Models which are 
                        resistant to being classified as models are more successful, and better representatives of data.
                         See below.</li>
					<li> The optimized cells were derived from a
                         custom built parallel genetic algorithm, utilizing pre-existing python tools:
                          ***DEAP*** and ***Dask***. It would have been desirable to optimize the models 
                          with an algorithm from this course, such as  Lasso, 
                          ridge regression, and elastic search (L1+L2)/2 regularization combined.
                           The way I do this is to run a genetic algorithm over the data,
                            The genetic algorithm is performing its own type of guided sparse sampling of the data.</li>

					<li>The Druckman feature analysis protocol originates from MATLAB code associated with the 
                        analysis of Blue Brain Project Modelled cells, this feature analysis pipeline was 
                        then ported to Python by Justas Birgiolas, at a later point 
                        I made the feature analysis pipeline applicable to optimized Adaptive Exponential 
                        and Izhiketch cells. Rick Gerkin and Vergil Haynes, assisted in data 
                        cleaning preperation and TSNE application.</li>

					<li> There is a great diversity of real biological neurons,
					all of which differ substantially in their electrical behavior. </li>
					<li> 	There are a few different classes of general purpose neuronal models,</li>
					<li> 	 that can reproduce these different types of electrical behaviours, </li>
					<li> 	given appropriate parameterizations of the models.</li>
					<!---<li> An exisiting class of neuron model type, called The Izhikevich model was </li>
					<li> published with parameter sets believed to make the model outputs accurately align </li>
					<li> with a variety of real biological cell outputs. However since publication much very</li>
					<li>  specific electro physiological recordings have accumulated, </li>
					<li> 		that in someways undermine model/experiment agreement. However it is now possible</li>
					<li> 		 to constrain the Izhikevich model and find new parameterizations that more allow us to </li>
					<li> 		 more accurately reproduce more recently published experimental data.</li>
					<li> In contrast to other projects that seek to use features to seperate and classify two</li>
					<li>  different categories of things that are hard to tell apart, such that humans can benefit </li>
					<li>  from a fast classification of hard to discern differences in high dimensional spaces. </li>
					<li>  In this project the goal is to use resistance to classification as an indicator of an </li>
					<li>   optimization algorithms success, and to use machine seperation of data categories as </li>
					<li>   an error signal, that directs us to precise locations of model failure. Another way of </li>
					<li> 	writing this, is, if a good/fair attempt at machine classification is hard, then then a </li>
					<li> 	 different machine learning algorithm did a good job. If machine classification is very easy, </li>
					<li> 	 the optimization algorithm did a poor job.</li>
					<li> The application of TSNE to data was developed in a research team context on different data </li>
					<li>	pertaining to ion channels, or the APs exclusively derived from models (as opposed to a combination </li>
					<li>	 of models and data). In the context of this project, I have used novel experimental data </li>
					<li>	 (pulled from the Allen Brain Portal API) and novel models (8 optimized cell models included), </li>
					 so I have re-applied a small amount of code from pre-established work, 
					 but I have made substantial novel contributions, by looking at different features,
					  applying different feature engineering, applying Random Forest Classification,
					   applying variance explained, and interpreting results. For a comparison to other
					    pre-established work that informed this work check [here](https://github.com/vrhaynes/LargeScaleModelAnalysis_2019/blob/master/model-data-clustering.ipynb)
